## Description  



### What's the problem?  
We all know how Native Android Development is not very friendly for a beginner to learn . So to combat this problem (and as native android developers) we built AndroLearn. AndroLearn aims to be a handbook for beginners to get started with android dev enthusiasts. The app has the list of all inbuilt components as well an exhaustive lists of Third party libraries , their attributes (necessary and optional) and much more !

### How can this project help?  

### The idea  

## Project structure  

```  
```  

## Project roadmap  

The project currently does the following things.  

-  User can see the types of components
-  User can see the necessary and optional attributes of each component


See below for our future steps.  

- Add to Favourites  
-  User can add more third party libraries
- Share Feature

## Getting started  
  Everyone is welcomed to contribute to our project. Mentioning in bold, **you do not need to know the tech stack and tools beforehand to be a part of our project**. This is a learn-and-build projects where the contributors build alongside learning the various concepts and technologies involved. <br />Below are a few prerequisites and installation guides:


### Prerequisites  
1. Basic Understanding of Programming Language (any) 
2.  OOPS
#### Softwares needed

-   [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=Cj0KCQjw1PSDBhDbARIsAPeTqrec4clA-r8NfjrJtz3aKnvme0feBN3F534uGCvqcxoclrQBFuQfANQaAgMPEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

#### Knowledge needed

The best way to learn the following is to google each and everything!

-   Very basic understanding of git and github:
